      "description": "The fresh Thai air,<br> the smell of the rainforest,<br> the sounds of the waves,<br> and the sights of Koh Phi Phi,<br> better known as James Bond Island.<br><br>Painting this was a trip through memory lane, reminiscing my experience in my mother’s home country of Thailand.",
      "Reflection": "Given the chaotic and somewhat unpredictable nature of watercolour, I found it difficult to illustrate the concepts and scenes with my relatively low experience at the time of painting. Watercolour proved to be a fairly difficult medium to master and put into its full potential, however, the process was simple but tedious. I knew that a good watercolour painting should have quality layering, so I had with me a hair dryer and opened my windows so the paint would dry quickly. This sped up the process of painting multiple layers quite a bit.<br><br>I viewed this painting like a test. Seeing how far I've come to just starting this medium roughly 8 months ago, to drawing a full scene with water reflections, proper colour usage, clouds, shadows, and efficient layering. Overall, I'm very proud of the result and I look forward to seeing what kind of style I'll acquire as I progress with my watercolour paintings.",

      "Reflection": "This painting was difficult in that it also tested my ability to glaze and layer my paint when using gouache. The process was quite long as I used pretty wet washes when painting the layers and having to wait was getting tedious, but I knew it was worth it.<br><br>I'm actually quite impressed with the outcome however I would probably use a more saturated green for the background if I had to make any improvements on it.",

      "Reflection": "I was heavily inspired by the British Photographer, Darren Almond, and his book called, \"Full Moon\". In it are photos taken during the night of a full moon, and using long exposures to make the moonlight seem like day but with an eerie fog. I wanted to add my own touch to this style and I noticed that most if not all the photos featured in Full Moon had no sign of man-made structures and the photos were taken while hiking in the wild. Thus, I looked towards rural areas, trying to capture human life during the night.<br><br>Though, I did face the same challenge that Darren encountered, and that was limited time. The pictures had to be taken on nights when the moon was full, bright, and clear enough that it could shine light in the area. Fortunately, the weather was clear and we could catch our opportunity.<br><br>However, if I could go back and fix one thing, I would first travel to the area during the day and rehearse the focus and the angles. Although the lack of focus adds its own character, I would've preferred to work in the dark, knowing what settings I should use.",

Something I love about street photography, is the \"raw emotion\" from each photo.<br><br>Being alone in such a \"liminal\" area within the foggy night, brought upon a lonely and empty feeling that I wanted to capture. My mindset during the street photography session was to go by instinct. However, the spontaneity of this art form made it difficult as you can't easily plan the situations around you. At the end of the night, I was very proud of the photos and had a lot of favorites. It was a very memorable night for me to capture the deserted University of Waterloo.",

      "text": "For most of my life, I have always admired art and design, but it wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I chose to pursue it as my lifelong career. I chose this program specifically because I want to paint my identity and use interior design as my canvas, no longer fantasizing about my ideal lifestyle. I hope I can paint for you a clear picture of how my journey through design and architecture began.<br>When I was younger, I used to view challenges negatively, holding a fixed mindset. But over time, I’ve grown to appreciate challenges as stepping stones to success. At times I would fail and become disappointed with myself for not being “good enough”. From this experience, I learned a crucial lesson: Aim for progression, not perfection. Many times I’ve let success get to my head and failure get to my heart. However, with this new shift in perspective, I have come to understand that the pain I receive from failure is far more beneficial as it’s allowed me to be complacent and modest in my personality and work ethic. I’ve since matured into a growth mindset, viewing my failures and challenges as building blocks to success.<br>A few years ago, we renovated and re-floored our home, so we took this opportunity to redecorate our interiors. We would often travel to IKEA as we were deciding how we would decorate our rooms. I vividly remember sitting down on my desk with my dotted notebook and measuring every corner of my room with a tape measure to make sure the furniture I wanted would fit the intentions of my design. It is difficult to explain with words how I felt as I designed my room, but the experience of sketching and designing with an endless number of creative opportunities within a set number of restrictions, brought upon a new passion for me to strive for. After the renovation, I learned that doing something you love doesn’t mean you will never work a day in your life, to me, it means that I’m willing to work hard for it because it’s something I’m passionate about and want to excel in that field. It was then that I finally understood what I wanted to pursue in the future.<br>Although I’ve long since admired the creative field, I’m still relatively new to the environment. I’m ready to embrace the countless challenges and problems I may face in the future, and I hope to learn from them and gain new experiences. A long-term goal of mine is to accumulate experience and carve into the ideal version of myself through design and architecture. With my experience with time management and having a good work ethic, I believe in myself to be able to overcome the obstacles I’ll inevitably receive. I hope to seek greater opportunities for honing my technical skills and creative process in a good learning environment that allows me to grow, both as a person and as a designer."
